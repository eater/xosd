= XOSD =

This is an unofficial mirror of XOSD from:
    https://svn.code.sf.net/p/libxosd/code
    
It now includes The Geek's antialiasing patch (which I did not create, I just found it at https://sites.google.com/site/bb1001dd/linux-hacks-and-patches/xosd-font-antialiasing-patch) to work with pango fonts. So the `-f` flag now takes arguments like `"Inconsolata 80"`.
